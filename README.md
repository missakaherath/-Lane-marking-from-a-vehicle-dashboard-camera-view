# Computer-Vision-Final-Assignment

1. Scaled using bilinear interpolation
2. Normalized the image
3. Filtered noise using linear filter and one non-linear filter
4. Subjected the image to edge detection based on the Canny edge detector
5. Using Hough transform, detect the road-lane markings from the edge-detected image
6. Superimposed the lane markings in RED colour and display the image
