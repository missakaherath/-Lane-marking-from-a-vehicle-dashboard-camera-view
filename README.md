# Computer-Vision-Final-Assignment

1. Bilinear interpolation for the scaling
2. Normalized the image
3. Filtered noise in the image using median filter and gaussian filter
4. Subjected the image to edge detection based on the Canny edge detector
5. Used Hough transform to detect the road-lane markings from the edge-detected image
6. Superimposed the lane markings in red colour
